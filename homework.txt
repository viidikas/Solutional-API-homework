# Homework Task

There is an API running at https://homework.solutional.ee. Your task is to
implement the same API. Functionality not offered by the reference API is not required to be implemented.

This is a fictional 3rd party API that has no documentation and there's no access to it's source code,
but due to third party integrations the API needs to stay exactly the same as it is.

NB! This API does not reflect Solutional's understanding of a good API design. If anything is unclear, feel free to ask.

## API General Description

API implements a very simple e-commerce cart/order flow:

1. It has a list of products;
2. Products can be added to the order;
3. Products can be modified within the order;
4. Products can be replaced when assembled.


## API Endpoints

Here's all the API endpoints with usage examples you need to implement:

* GET /api/products - list of all available products
    ```
    curl https://homework.solutional.ee/api/products
    ```

* POST /api/orders - create new order
    ```
    curl -X POST https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders
    ```

* GET /api/orders/:order_id - get order details
    ```
    curl https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id
    ```

* PATCH /api/orders/:order_id - update order
    ```
    curl -X PATCH --data '{"status": "PAID"}' \
      https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id
    ```

* GET /api/orders/:order_id/products - get order products
    ```
    curl https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id/products
    ```

* POST /api/orders/:order_id/products - add products to order
    ```
    curl --data '[123]' -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id/products
    ```

* PATCH /api/orders/:order_id/products/:product_id - update product quantity
    ```
    curl -X PATCH --data '{"quantity": 33}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id/products/:product_id
    ```

* PATCH /api/orders/:order_id/products/:product_id - add a replacement product
    ```
    curl -X PATCH --data '{"replaced_with": {"product_id": 123, "quantity": 6}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      https://homework.solutional.ee/api/orders/:order_id/products/:product_id
    ```

## Goals

1. Implement all API endpoints described above;
2. For `GET /api/products` endpoint keep products list exactly the same as is
   done in the reference API - same products with same attributes (even `id`);
3. Make it possible to configure listening port number of the application without any need to change the code;
4. Before starting actual development, provide us with an estimation of when this task is going to be ready.

PS! For simplicity - orders do not need to be persisted between application restarts.
